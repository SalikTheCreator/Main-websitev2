					<h1>Hello I'm Salik</h1>
					<p>A Californian born and raised software engineering student, looking to build a skill set in coding.</p>
					
					<p> I plan on working on my own coding projects throughout my life and would love to work with others on their projects!</p>

					<p> I hope to get to the point where when I am given a concept for a coding project, in which I can execute what the client desires.</p>
		  
					<p> I am a guitarist, gamer, and car detailer who wants to get a job that revolves around coding. I am exceptional at looking for imperfections and fixing them efficiently.</p>
		  
					 <p> I am passionate about technology and want to bring my own creative input into this field. </p>
		  
					 <h3> What I do with my free time:</h3>
		  
				  <p>• Looking up recipes, cooking, and tinkering with ingredients to get the perfect recipe.</p>
		  
				  <p>• Staring at my Steam library and figuring out which video game to play next.</p>
		  
				  <p>• Thinking about playing guitar, but never having the time to play guitar. This may be because I'm a very determined person when I am focused on my overall objective.</p>
		  
				  <p>• Researching current growth in the technological field both hardware and software.</p>
		  
				  <p>• Contemplating philosophical concepts and thoughts that can be present in my daily life or in the lives of others, which results in a lack of sleep.</p>

	<section class="dark-background" id="about">
      <h2>Computer Enthusiast</h2>
      <div class="group">
        <div class="item item-double">
			<p>Built my first custom gaming computer in 2012, and since then I have actively tried to stay up to date with new technology.</p>
           <p> At the age of two, I was enjoying the video game experience on an NES. From there on out, I ended up spending substantial time on gaming systems. </p>
        <p>Software is just as critical as hardware. Hardware without the software is a chunk of silicon, and software without hardware is just a jumble of words and numbers.</p>
           <p> Being part of the ever-changing technological world is my main aspiration, so progressing in my knowledge of coding is my main priority.</p>

		 <h2>Hard Worker</h2>
      <div class="group">
        <div class="item item-double">
			<p> Goals equate to nothing without hard work and dedication. Once I start a job, a project, or schooling endeavor, I am dedicated to completing it to the best of my ability.</p>
				<p>I am a perfectionist, so I seek out all the minor imperfections. This may result in some projects taking longer than expected, but the results always speak volumes. I plan on learning how to work more effectively, but still allow my perfectionist attitude to determine the strength of my work ethic. </p>
			   <p>Worked 12 hours plus schedules detailing cars while maintaining focus.</p>
			   <p>Worked multiple team-oriented jobs; such as, fast food for over two years, retail jobs for over a year, and detailing cars with teams for over 2 years.</p>

		<h2>Musician</h2>
	 <div class="group">
	   <div class="item item-double">
<p>Music is powerful, and being able to create music lets me grasp the emotions inside that are hard to express in words.</p>
		<p> I have been able to self-reflect from playing guitar since the age of 15. Playing guitar is my form of meditation. </p>
		<p>Music, like many arts, is a language that transcends all our prejudices and communication barriers. This makes it a valuable asset to many peoples' lives. </p>

          <h3>Ceasar, Polybius, Substitution Cypher</h3>
					<p> Ciphers are tools used to encode and decode text, great for masking passwords as well as sending secret messages. Learned how to loop so when given a string parameter it would return an encoded message or decode a message.</p>
